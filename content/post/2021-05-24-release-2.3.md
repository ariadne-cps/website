This new version introduces concurrency in the library, applied to evolution routines and drawing at the moment. We also offer the ability to add arguments to executables (both C++ and Python) in order to set variables such as concurrency level, drawer to be used or logger verbosity.

Legenda:

- N: new feature
- A: addition to a feature
- C: change to the behavior of a feature
- F: fixed feature
- R: removed feature

Changes:

- [#538](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/538) (N) Introduce a concurrency module designed for parallel execution of internal tasks
- [#549](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/549) (N) Introduce a Least Recently Used cache utility for holding a limited number of homogeneous objects
- [#559](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/559) (N) Introduce an optional ariadne_main.hpp that offers an ariadne_main() function handling all header tasks for an executable   
- [#562](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/562) (N) Introduce a command line interface class for acquiring CLI input arguments setting logger verbosity, theme and scheduler, along with concurrency, graphics backend and drawer  
- [#561](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/561) (A) Add Python bindings for TaskManager in order to control concurrency
- [#570](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/570) (A) Add Python bindings for GraphicsManager in order to control drawer and graphics backend  
- [#571](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/571) (A) Add Python bindings for Logger in order to expose (themed) logging
- [#599](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/599) (A) Add extra Python bindings for HybridEnclosure, add Python subscripting for ListSet<HybridEnclosure> 
- [#602](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/602) (A) Add extra Python bindings for Enclosure, add Python bindings for Point2d for graphics
- [#605](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/605) (A) Add Python bindings for CommandLineInterface, to acquire arguments to a Python script  
- [#551](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/551) (C) Make VectorFieldEvolver process sets in parallel (when splitting initially or during evolution)
- [#556](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/556) (C) Disallow unsafe default value of upper semantics for orbit methods
- [#565](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/565) (C) Draw lists of (Labelled/Hybrid)Enclosure in parallel  
- [#563](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/563) (C) Rename the 'output' module into the 'io' module to support future classes related to input  
- [#566](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/566) (C) Make HybridEvolver process sets in parallel (due to either splitting or multiple trajectories)
- [#573](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/573) (C) Use an LRU cache for modes in CompositeHybridAutomaton, avoid exhausting a given mode in HybridEvolver before changing mode
- [#580](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/580) (C) VectorFieldEvolver, IteratedMapEvolver and HybridEvolver now check that the initial enclosure is consistent
- [#592](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/592) (C) Enclosure now uses the global GraphicsManager drawer instead of having a dedicated configuration field
- [#595](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/595) (C) Modify examples to use ariadne_main function for simplicity, tutorials are not changed  
- [#539](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/539) (F) A segmentation fault sometimes would be issued when terminating the executable, due to logging
- [#557](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/557) (F) Fix behavior of StopWatch utility for concurrent code, enhance the class for choosing a duration type
- [#567](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/567) (F) Fix problem with state_time space creation when state space already contains the 't' variable
- [#576](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/576) (F) Fix HybridEnclosure state_set() incorrectly working when an auxiliary function is present
- [#578](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/578) (F) Fix VectorFieldEvolver not storing the auxiliary mapping to the initial enclosure created from an expression set
- [#581](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/581) (F) Fix Enclosure splittings not carrying over the auxiliary mapping  
- [#558](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/558) (R) Remove unnecessary IteratedMapEvolver::enclosure methods
- [#552](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/552) (R) Remove evolve/reach/reach_evolve methods from EvolverInterface, relying on orbit generation only
- [#553](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/553) (R) Remove ability to write an evolver object to the standard output, since it was implemented as a fixed string for all evolvers anyway
