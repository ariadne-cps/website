In this minor release we mainly address Python bindings, which now cover all layers of functionality up to hybrid evolution.
As a consequence, now C++ and Python tutorials mirror each other.

This is also the first release that comes with Homebrew and Aptitude packages for quick installation of the library.

Installation and Tutorial sections have been updated accordingly.

Legenda:

- N: new feature
- A: addition to a feature
- C: change to the behavior of a feature
- F: fixed feature
- R: removed feature
