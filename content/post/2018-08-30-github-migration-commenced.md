In order to get access to a wider open-source community and also to exploit better continuous integration services, we are migrating from GitBucket to GitHub. 

The new source site will become

[https://github.com/ariadne-cps](https://github.com/ariadne-cps)

with a new organization called ariadne-cps as part of the GitHub Education program.

The original repositories on BitBucket will be removed as of October the 1st.

There will be an additional news in the next few days to announce the completion of the migration process.
