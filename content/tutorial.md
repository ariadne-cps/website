This tutorial has the purpose of providing detailed information for *users* of the library. It is split into three sections:

  1. [Description of a simple system](#the-system) that will be used for the tutorial;
  2. [Construction of a model](#model-construction) for the system;
  3. [Analysis of the model](#model-analysis), in terms of both evolution and verification.

In particular, Ariadne currently uses a programmatic C++ approach to describe a model and analyze it. The full code presented in the following is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/ariadne-cps/release-1.0/src/HEAD/tutorial/) as a simple self contained example with extensive comments.
